                                Through our Food for Life effort, we’re creating new strategies to make healthy food accessible to everyone, while fostering the important social and cultural connections that food provides. For example, this fall we launched
                                a texting campaign reaching hundreds of
                                thousands of members to identify and enroll members who qualify for CalFresh—California’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program—to enable them to overcome financial barriers to healthy, nutritious food. Looking forward, we seek to influence the food economy by using Kaiser Permanente’s purchasing power to support local and sustainable food sourcing.

                                    key leaders who came
                                    together to confront a growing need for more capacity for mental health services and substance abuse treatment. Be Well Orange County envisions a comprehensive mental health “system of care,” featuring 3 Regional Wellness Hubs. The initial Wellness Hub in the city of Orange, which broke ground this fall, will provide a range of crisis stabilization, mental health services, substance abuse treatment, and residential care, as well as a mobile crisis response team, transportation, social services, employment, education, and legal aid to anyone in need, regardless of ability to pay.

                            Although health care is vitally important, the economic, social, and environmental conditions in our communities have a far more significant impact on how long we live and how well we live. On average, people who experience higher poverty and higher unemployment have a shorter lifespan and worse health outcomes than those who live in economically vibrant areas.

                            Therefore, to advance our mission to improve the health of our communities, we’re tackling the root causes of poor health. We’re trying to increase economic opportunity and create good-paying jobs. We’re strengthening the supply of affordable housing and services to reduce homelessness and alleviate housing insecurity. We’re supporting schools as the “heart of health” in communities because educational attainment
                            is a powerful predictor of lifelong health. And we’re actively committed to environmental stewardship by supporting sustainable livable communities.

                                into a partnership with the

                                and the Kern County Public

                                the alarming rates of sexually
                                transmitted diseases among

                                young adults. Between 2017
                                and 2019, ET’s play, “What Goes Around,” was featured in every high school across the district for the first time. Hip and entertaining, the performance frankly addresses the facts and myths about STDs, teaches prevention, and helps students see how the choices they make have a lasting impact on their lives and the lives of other people.                            </p>
